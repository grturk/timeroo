# Rings Timer

## Idea

This app is designed for gymnasts, particularly those practicing on the rings. An exercise on rings typically involves several static elements, each of which must be held for at least two seconds. However, gymnasts and their coaches often struggle to count this time objectively due to the physical difficulty of the elements. A simple timer or stopwatch isn't sufficient because the coach needs to keep their eyes on the gymnast, not the device, to reset the timer and start it for every new element. To address this issue, I created this straightforward app to assist coaches and gymnasts in optimizing their training.

## App

The app features a user-friendly interface with a single large button that starts the timer and emits a short sound, signaling to both the gymnast and the coach that the timer has started. When the time runs out, another sound plays, and the timer is immediately reset, ready for the next press. The button's size allows the coach to operate it without needing to look at the phone during the exercise, ensuring accurate timing. The duration can be adjusted by one second or half a second using the increment and decrement buttons.

## Technologies

The app is developed for the Android operating system using Android Studio, with Java and XML for programming and layout design.
